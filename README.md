This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).



What was your favorite part of building this?
My favorite part was exploring new things — every project is an opportunity to learn and try something fresh. Whether experimenting with new libraries or trying out different solutions, I love discovering new tools and techniques that elevate the final product.

What was the hardest, and how did you handle it?
The hardest part was implementing the dark and light mode functionality. It took some time to get the right balance and ensure the theme switched seamlessly across the app. I tackled it by diving deep into CSS variables and leveraging React’s state management to handle the theme switching. It wasn’t easy, but it was rewarding to see it come together smoothly in the end.








## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
